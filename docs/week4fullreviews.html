                            The efficiency of using the issues and project board in developing my projects has been very substantial. I still need to spend time grasping the concepts of branching and why it is super useful, and also understanding the full concept of issues, because one issue I was running into was that I was treating issues as project board goals, and that began to conflict with my project board creation. Two things I need to learn for sure in the future for git when I start working on bigger projects is branching and pull requests!

                <p>Overall: This week was very beneficial, I was able to translate all of my applications into Typescript, and I was also able to fully(almost fully) finish my final project! I learned the ins and outs of React, I learned how to use useEffect, and useState, how to chunk up my applications into components, utilities, and assets. Very beneficial and productive week in learning and improving my overall knowledge of Typescript itself, React majorly, and creating web applications!</p>
