                            I've been paying attention to make sure to include more details in my commits, sometimes I just write a single word, and I have been trying to improve upon my commit message to make sure it is clear what I have implemented and or am pushing to the repository. I have been looking into branching and it's benefits to 1)Fix bugs where they may occur while still maintaining a MVP and also 2)Allow for features to be easily locatable by their branch, such as adding a multiply feature to my calculator app. I will start looking into Git Pull Requests in Week3 to get an idea of what those mean, when and why they should be implemented and whether I should begin using them in my repositories. I will also look into making sure that I am very familiar with publishing a React App in github, because the process is still hazy as of right now.

                            I have been typing all of my React Apps solely in Javascript, and I did this to 1)Improve my Javascript skills and build upon an understanding of the React library before diving into the types that each variable are, understanding the general flow of the library itself, and 2) To start to develop the ability to reverse-translate javascript code to Typescript code(considering that typescript is translated to javascript to run). The implementation in Javascript has not been too difficult, the only part where I made a mistake was implementing all of my apps in Class-based React and then having to translate all of my apps into functional-hook based React Apps

                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li id="row3col1typescript">

                    <b>Typescript</b>
                    
                    <ul>

                        <li>

                            I have been developing my Typescript skills thanks to an online exercise website, where they present coding problems and it consists of a level-up system, which adds extra drive to complete more problems. So far, my understanding of the variable:type syntax is very familiar, however, I still need to develop my recognition of object destructuring in Typescript, Dr. Bart showed destructuring in class today, and I was very confused at first looking at the code before knowing it was destructuring, but once he explained what it was, I immediately knew what was happening, because I am very familiar with destructing thanks to coding problems I have come across in Javascript, considering that is where Typescript inherits it's destructuring ability is from Javascript. The only part of Typescript I have yet to explore is the React-Typescript implementation, so far I have only been building apps in Javascript, and for Week 3. It is my goal to 1)Develop a small app in Typescript-React, and 2) Translate my apps from functional-js-react to functional-ts-react, I am very familiar with the JSX notation at this point, the only obstacle hindering my ability to fully dive into TS-React is the types of functional-hooks and props, how those play out type-wise. Otherwise, I have been learning more and more Typescript general syntax at a steady pace, excited to start learning TS-React for Week3!
