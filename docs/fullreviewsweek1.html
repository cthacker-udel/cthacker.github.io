                            I've been making sure to commit regularly, and frequently, always take a couple steps forward every day, always contribute even a line of a code one day, as long as some form of progress is being made, it makes the whole project a ton easier. I learned a ton about Git in CISC210, reached out to the professor for extra knowledge on how merges work, how to revert to commit, and the overall structure of the Git Version Control System. I learned a lot about Git from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sjqTHE0zok">this lecture</a>, which is very informative and starts off broad, and narrows into the specifics later in.

                            Beginning was to fill out the main portfolio page, which was a hassle before I started using bootstrap to help me format my page. I started learning/refreshing <a href="https://marksheet.io/">HTML</a> syntax thanks to the link Dr. Bart suggested Here, using that resource, it quickly brought me back up to speed and was a very thorough guide. Using this guide, I attempted to construct my first HTML page in quite a while using just my skills so far in HTML and CSS, and was that difficult, the CSS was giving me so much trouble formatting the margins, formatting the spacing correct, I just couldn't get the spacing correct. Then I discovered Bootstrap, and now I preach it like the gospel, it's so easy to learn for beginners, the most crucial part is the row-column formatting, that alone can make your web page look 100x better and easier to maintain too. Using this link to <a href="https://sun.iwu.edu/~mliffito/cs_codex/posts/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> from the Canvas page <b>Portfolio Description</b>, there are tons of resources available to hone your skills in any of the technologies being impleemnted in this project.

                            I began my journey on Javascript prior to this class, however, I had yet to implement Javascript in a browser, mostly coding functions and non-browser applications. I recently started looking into NodeJS and then planning to branch into ReactJS. I saw one of the idea that Dr. Bart had proposed, was a <b>Random Team Name Generator</b>, and I learned a ton about APIs during my internship over this past winter, mostly how to interact with them, make HTTP requests and get back JSON in both Java and Python, mostly Java however. The word <em>Random</em> stuck out to me, because I know there is some form of a random number generator function embedded into most languages, but I wanted a random <em>word</em>, so I was searching for a random word API to make a request to and get back random word(s), and here I stumbled upon <a href="https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com">this random word generator API website</a>. With query parameters and everything to format the words the server sends back. I knew this was the website I was going to use, very simplistic, just make a request to the url. I began looking into resources on generally how to <a href="https://www.kirupa.com/html5/making_http_requests_js.htm">make a HTTP request in JS</a>, and I was struggling because the code I was implementing <a href="scripts.js">seen here commented out at the bottom of the file</a>, was NodeJS code, and I was having difficulty implementing that code in the browser, I had to add files, some of the files did not work due to it being a NodeJS file. I landed upon the function <em>fetch</em>, which makes a async request to the url. One of the problems I had to overcome was, how do I synchronously gather/ utilize the data from a async request? The answer was a callback function, so when I received the data, I passed it into a separate(<em>synchronous</em>) function, which would update the actual HTML of the file. Once I tested everything with alerts/console.log (<em>I will be learning Jest<small> -can you use jest on async(request) functions? </small></em>) That has been my journey so far in JS.

                            I started learning Typescript recently, following mostly the guide(<small>very nice guide by the way!</small>) posted by Dr. Bart under the Portfolio Description Page, specifically this book: <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-typescript/9781492037644/">Programming Typescript: O'Reilly</a>. I am more of a visual learner and I like challenges along the way, I learn a lot by reading documents or tutorials online. This book has been fantastic from the first page, going over in depth about types in Typescript and how they differ from Javascript. I appreciate the attention to detail such as explaining how the TSC compiler works, and explaining the issues with JS and how TS fixes them. Such as instead of compiling their code at run-time, TS continuously compiles it's code to spot any type errors, and alert the programmer to them. I find this language to be labor-intensive at first(<small>more typing, more bugs(not a bad thing!)</small>), but as you get the hang of the language, the overall sense of freedom you feel when coding in this type of language. It is a lot more freedom then per-se Javascript. This topic about freedom appeared in an earlier class I took, CISC210(Introduction to Systems Programming), which touched on the topic of Freedom, and C is an absolute free language, considering there is no garbage collector, you have to define every type, you have to manage every piece of memory you borrow. The freedom lies in the programmer being able to feel in control with their computer, and knowing how to manipulate the BASH terminal embodies that feeling of being in control. The Typescript Language compared to Javascript has a stronger feeling of being in control, knowing when there is a bug in your code, knowing what type this variable is and declaring it as such, being able to control what types are passed into a function, what it returns. Those aspects of this language make the programmer feel more in control of what they are programming. Freedom is the absolute foundation of GNU, open-source for everyone and free. Back on topic, my learning style is practice, I reinforce all the material by practicing, whether its doing practice problems from the textbook, or finding websites online, or even creating my own side projects. I usually desire to have a strong foundation of the basics, a very firm understanding of the beginner-intermediate level code, and then begin to start reaching for advanced level style syntax. I found this website which has tons of practice problems, and even a island-themed progression, moving from island to island, leveling up, the website it called <a href="https://js.checkio.org/">CheckiO</a>. If i continue on this path for the rest of the week, I will surely become very familiar with Typescript and begin venturing into Typescript React waters.
