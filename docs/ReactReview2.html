                <p>Over the course of 4?(Maybe 5) weeks, I have gone from not even knowing what React was, to using the useState, useEffect, splitting up applications into components, assets, and utilities. Being able to make web applications, this course has been so beneficial to my knoweledge of web applications and my continued growth in web development. React is such a useful tool for making web applications, easy to use, and the functional hook is a very efficient way of managing which components change, which components depend on eachother, and what components do when they are re-rendered, or even rendered to begin with. This journey from 0 to 100 in React has been such a pleasure to do, and the way I learned it mostly through projects and tutorials online, not strictly just through lecture, is amazing. I will definitely 1000% be using React in the future for every web application I create!</p>
