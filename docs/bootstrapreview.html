                <p>I followed the link posted in canvas, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-bootstrap-4-grid-system-in-10-minutes-e83bfae115da/">here</a>, under the resources for bootstrap, and this tutorial
                    absolutely hit the nail on the head. It goes over the fundamentals first instead of looking at multiple technical docs, and teaches you the layout that bootstrap implements. Once you
                    understand the rows and columns mechanism, formatting your page layout is seamless, super efficient. I am so so very glad I took the time to import and utilize bootstrap in my project,
                    the ease of use so far in the beginning, formatting with rows and columns, provides such a simplistic and elegant layout to my page. </p>

                <p>Overall : I would recommend bootstrap to anyone trying to make their time formatting their page appearance and less error-prone. Bootstrap has both increased my efficiency and the overall ease-of-use of formatting a page without a lot of stylings in play, just using divs to format the page accordingly.</p>
