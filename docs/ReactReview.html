                <p>So for React, my first impression was a very complicated, multi-faceted library that was going to take me forever to learn. Once I started delving into the actual subject matter however, thanks to the tutorial provided by Dr. Bart, in which we made a Tic-Tac Toe game in React, I started to realized both the benefit, and the ease-of-use of React. I first started out with building a simple shopping cart html page, you would click a button, and it would add to a list. I started with 1 input, and 1 output. Then I began to evolve into the Calculator, where I had two inputs, both the left and right operand, and one output, the text box. Learning how to utilize multiple inputs was crucial to the beginning of working on larger and larger applications. This then lead to Battleship, where I would have a NxN amount of inputs, and how could I handle those inputs. The longer I spent typing React code, the more understanding and appreciation I developed for what a remarkable, and strong library this codebase was. It not only functions very well, and displays stellar results, but the overall satisfaction of creating a web app from scratch, that not only handles inputs, but sends that data from input to outputs, is astounding.</p>


                <p>Overall: I would recommend anyone React for a beginner lesson in Web-Dev, it handles all the backend work(development server, building) and allows the user to fully develop whichever app they choose to make. Very efficient and enjoyable library to utilize!</p>
