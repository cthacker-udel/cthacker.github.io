                <p>Typescript so far has been very easy to learn, majorly because I already had extensive Javascript knowledge, I was familiar with deconstructing, I was familiar with types from Java and even Python(108). The most difficult part of Typescript is encountering types I am unsure of, such as objects, and not primitives(well not technically primitives) such as number and string.
                    The most challenging part of this Typescript journey would have to be mastering Typescript-React, however, learning this knowledge will make me very skilled at developing React applications because I will not only know the implementation of the functions, but also the types of the return values of the functions, and how to deconstruct props that are passed in to the components. Typescript overall has been a very beneficial journey to using a language that is constantly monitoring the types you assign variables to and double checking to make sure they are implemented correctly.
                    </p>


                <p>Overall: I would recommend Typescript to any programmer looking to levelup their Javascript to a more type-checked version!</p>
