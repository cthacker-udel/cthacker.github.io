                <p>Overall: Not at all a difficult process translating a chunk of Javascript to Typescript, the only block I ran into would be with the MouseEvents and figuring out how to destructure props when passed into the function. One of the specific difficulties was figuring out which type the setters from the useState function were, and defining those in the props that I was destructuring. Very enjoyable process, taking code that has no types at all and defining all of the variables and making sure that your code functions correctly before even running it. One of the benefits of using Typescript is its linter, which catches errors quick and makes sure your code is right before even running it. Which is a relief from Javascript where you hope your code runs when you run it and you hope that there are no exceptions
