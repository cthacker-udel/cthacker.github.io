                            I've been using the Project Board a lot more often and also raising Issues more frequently when I run into bugs in my applications. The usage of the Project Board and Issues has increased my organization a lot and made my programming more efficient in terms of keeping a log of problems solved and the project board aiding in forwarding as well as keeping my progress in the project able to be located in one interface.

                <p>Overall, I would say that this week has not been my best showing, I only say that because I haven't created any applications this week, mostly been fixing/debugging applications and learning extra material, compared to my past weeks where I was developing 3-4 applications a week. This was my debugging week, I fixed the problems with the calculator application, and refined the connect4 and battleship implementation. I am to focus entirely next week on fully developing Poker to the best of my ability. I have been developing my skills before I start using them in applications. Making sure I understand what is going on before I either paste code from sources(referenced of course), or try using functions I find in the reference docs. I have been building my understanding this week, not building applications, mostly debugging applications, understanding how to fix errors in the applications. The process of my portfolio has basically taken this path: the first few weeks was creation, creating apps and making sure they atleast function. This week, was where I went and didn't create any new apps, but rather refined my current ones to working order, made sure that they functioned correctly, which enhanced my understanding even more. Although I did not create much this week, I increased my understanding of the React library itself and the implementations of it in my code.</p>
