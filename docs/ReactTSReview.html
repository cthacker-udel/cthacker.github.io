                <p>Typescript React has been a not-so-difficult journey, mostly due to the fact that I already had typescript knowledge going into this excursion. This pre-knowledge was mostly due to the multiple applications I created in React-JS that gave me extensive knowledge about how React functions, and the only difference is the declaration of types as you move through developing the application. One of the most difficult problems using React-TS by far has been 1) Remebering to add the <> braces after useState<example>(value) and also deconstructing props that are passed in. Overall however, developing react applications in Typescript has further advanced my knowledge of Typescript tenfold, very beneficial to learn overall and will continue to develop my Typescript expertise after this class ends.
